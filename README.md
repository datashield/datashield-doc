DataSHIELD Documentation, R notebooks, etc

## Ideas on how to fill this repo

Currently lots of instructions and guides on how to use DataSHIELD are stored on the [confluence wiki](https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/overview?homepageId=12943453).

However, as we all know, there are a host of problems associated with confluence products: user-capped (at 10), [extremely costly expansion plans](https://newcastle.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/DataSHIELDTeam/EVpRDLeGSDhKvFNRpNTdPM8B1mwvBZ31XDI90E0uEL-cIw?e=Qvv3ce), constantly changing (and seemingly removing) functionality, legacy files in a big mess that need a thorough clean out anyway.

Perhaps instead, we collect all the workable vignettes, convert them into R-markdown format, publish them here, and build up a wiki for this repo to stitch them together in a "use-in-this-order" way, with a bit of background explanation as well.

Any suggestions by others, feel free to add to my thoughts! :)

## Further thoughts on this repo:

IN the Thursday Technical meeting on 6th May 2021 [youtube link](https://youtu.be/9O30hxMeKRE) Andrei suggested exploring a website-integrated wiki rather than this collection of vignettes, which may call its future into question? While vignettes are good, they do need to be interlinked and it would be all the better if they were community-driven so the content creation isn't all on us.
